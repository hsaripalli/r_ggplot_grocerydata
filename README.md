# r_ggplot_grocerydata
Visualization of grocery data set using R ggplot 

Using the sample grocery data set, I created the following visualizations: 

1. A scatterplot of grocery bill and the distance to store.
2. A boxplot of family income, broken out by the number of adults.
3. A histogram of family income
4. A bar chart showing the total sales by family size.
5. Visualize family income, grocery bill, and vegetarians in one chart
